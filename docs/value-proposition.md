## The problem

When working in scientific context there are many information in different sources. In addition there are also personal thoughts and ideas about the content a person is reading. For writing scientific papers it is important to have a system for sorting and clustering the notes. 

## Our solution

This application provides the technical base for taking notes, qualifying them and creating clusters of notes for the same topic. 
There are .. main functions:
 Taking notes
 Connecting notes to bibliographic information
 Adding tags to notes
 Connecting notes to related notes
 Deleting notes that are unnecessary
 

## Target user

The primary target group are graduating students writing their final thesis. 
In general the method and application can be used in every context where notes and information has to be clustered and managed. Currently there is just the option to work on one project at the time. Because of this it is not perfectly fitted for people who work on more than one project at the time.
