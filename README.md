All files and documents for the submission of the project ‘Zettelkasten’ are saved in this repository. This is the submission of the second examination in the module Fullstack Web Development in the winter semester 24/25.

## To run the program follow these steps:

1. Create a local copy of this repository.
2. Open the folder in VS Code (or any other environment you prefer).
3. Create a new terminal.
4. Create a virtual environment using the terminal.
   1. Mac: python3 -m venv venv
   2. Windows: python -m venv venv
5. Install all packages listed in the requirements.txt by 'pip install ...'.
6. Run the app with 'flask --app app/app run' in the terminal.
7. Follow the instructions shown in the terminal. (Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.)

Maybe you have to do a bit of troubleshooting or adapt steps because of different requisites. 

## Comments on the current version:

The category can't be empty. Before you create a note you have to create the first category, so you can choose this category later when creating the note. 
The notes can not be manipulated because I didn't manage to make the categories accessible in the form for changing the notes.
